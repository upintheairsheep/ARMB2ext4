Android Recovery Mode Backup to .ext4

This tool converts .backup, .backup1, .backup2, .backup3, .backup4, .backup5, and so on to .ext4 files to be extracted with 7Zip, restored with a custom recovery, or analysed with a forensic software.

I don't have a linux pc or a sample file, if you have a sample file make it an issue. If you have a Linux PC or a Mac tell me if the script succeded or failed. I just learned bach to make this script.

I don't have a donation page yet. But I am sought after a .ipa of Gizmonauts and the source code or packages of the frogotten Cyder/Cycaca Project.
